# Frequently asked questions on the coursework


1. The question: *I have attempted Q1 of the coursework. Because my function is a trig function there is an infinite amount of stationary points. I was wondering how many to include in my working out?*
    
    My Response: Well yes, the presence of trigonometric functions, which are periodic and so have an infinite number of zeroes, can lead to an infinite number of critical points for your function. So as per the question you should find and classify them all. You will need to describe them systematically with the use of some parameter(s). For example, we can say that the zeroes of $\cos(x)$ occur at the points $x = k \pi + \pi/2$, where $k$ is an integer. In that way we can describe them all and treat different groups of them depending on which integers k we are referring to. 

    You will need to do a similar thing in your coursework.
